This review provides a comprehensive overview of the latest advancements in superheavy nuclei synthesis, focusing on both the experimental and theoretical developments. We summarizes the primary synthesis methods the experimental plans and theoretical predictions for synthesizing new superheavy elements. Future directions offering new pathways for discovering unknown superheavy nuclei are also discussed.
