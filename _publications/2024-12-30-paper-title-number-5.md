The $^{252}$Cf isotope produced at Oak Ridge National Laboratory is a promising target material for the synthesis of new superheavy nuclei through fusion reaction experiments. Within the framework of the dinuclear system model, the reaction systems with the $^{252}$Cf target and the $^{48}$Ca, $^{45}$Sc, $^{50}$Ti, $^{51}$V, $^{54}$Cr, $^{55}$Mn projectiles are investigated for the synthesis of new isotopes $^{295-297}$Og, $^{292-294}$119, $^{297-299}$120, $^{298-300}$121, $^{301-303}$122 and $^{302-304}$123. The decreasing trend of the maximal evaporation residue cross sections with the increasing proton number of the compound nucleus are discussed in the capture, fusion and survival stages. Additionally, the radioactive beam-induced reactions based on the $^{252}$Cf target are investigated to reach the predicted neutron shell closure $N$ = 184, with the maximal evaporation residue cross section predicted to be 21 fb for synthesizing $^{302}$Og. The predicted results fall below the current detection limitation, indicating the necessity for advancement in both accelerator and detection techniques, as well as exploration of alternative reaction mechanisms.
