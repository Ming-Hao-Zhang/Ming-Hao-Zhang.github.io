  The <sup>252</sup>Cf isotope produced at Oak Ridge National Laboratory is a promising target material for the synthesis of new superheavy nuclei through fusion reaction experiments. Within the framework of the dinuclear system model, the reaction systems with the <sup>252</sup>Cf target are investigated for the synthesis of new isotopes with <i>Z</i>=118-123. Additionally, the radioactive beam-induced reactions based on the <sup>252</sup>Cf target are investigated to reach the predicted neutron shell closure <i>N</i> = 184. The predicted results fall below the current detection limitation, indicating the necessity for advancement in both accelerator and detection techniques, as well as exploration of alternative reaction mechanisms.
