In this article, we introduce the development of transport models such as the dinuclear system (DNS) model, quantum molecular dynamics (QMD) type model, Boltzmann type model, and Time-dependent Hatree-Fock (TDHF) type model, and conclude with their latest applications in the synthesis of superheavy nuclei, especially in fusion reactions and multinucleon transfer reactions. In addition, various international large-scale scientific facilities, as well as their scientific objectives, and future plans, are also summarized.
