The synthesis of superheavy elements <i>Z</i> = 121 was systematically studied through combinations of stable projectiles with 
<i>Z</i> = 21â€“30 and targets with half-lives exceeding 50 d. The influence of mass asymmetry and isotopic dependence on the projectile and target nuclei was investigated in detail.
