Within the framework of the dinuclear system model, the experimentally accessible projectile-target combinations are predicted for the production of new superheavy elements with 𝑍=119 and 𝑍=120. The entrance channel effect and the isotopic dependence of targets and projectiles on the capture, fusion, and survival stages of the fusion reaction are discussed.
