Within the framework of the dinuclear system (DNS) model, our study investigates the potential for synthesizing new superheavy elements with atomic numbers Z = 119 to 121 and explores the feasibility of reaching the predicted 'island of stability.' Optimal projectile-target combinations and their corresponding incident energies are predicted. Additionally, the isotopic dependence of both the target and projectile is analyzed.
