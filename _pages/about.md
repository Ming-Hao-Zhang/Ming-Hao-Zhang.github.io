I obtained my Ph.D. in 2025 from the [School of Physics and Astronomy](https://physics.bnu.edu.cn/), [Beijing Normal University](https://www.bnu.edu.cn/). My research interest includes fusion reaction, multi-nucleon transfer reaction and machine learning methods.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Feng-Shou Zhang](https://physicsfaculty.bnu.edu.cn/teacher/172/index.html) of The Key Laboratory of Beam Technology of Ministry of Education from [School of Physics and Astronomy](https://physics.bnu.edu.cn/), [Beijing Normal University](https://www.bnu.edu.cn/).
