I obtained my Ph.D. in 2025 from the [School of Physics and Astronomy](https://physics.bnu.edu.cn/), [Beijing Normal University](https://www.bnu.edu.cn/). My research interests include fusion reactions, multi-nucleon transfer reactions, and the application of machine learning methods in nuclear theory.

During my doctoral studies, I worked on theoretical modeling and computational approaches to heavy-ion reactions, with a focus on the dinuclear system model. I have co-authored several research articles published in Physical Review C and Nuclear Science and Techniques, and I also serve as a reviewer for Nuclear Science and Engineering.
